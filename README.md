# Campu-site

Campu is a blog framework based on Nuxt.

It's @Jasonzyt's first web frontend project.

Still under construction.

## Build
  
```
pnpm install
pnpm run build
```

## Deploy

[./.github/workflows/deploy.yml](./.github/workflows/deploy.yml) provided a way to deploy the site to your own server.

Since the static support with Nuxt Content is under development, GitHub Pages deployment is not supported at the moment. (see [nuxt/content#1229](https://github.com/nuxt/content/issues/1229))
